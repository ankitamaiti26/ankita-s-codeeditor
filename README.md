# ankita-s-codeeditor
The repository consists of my latest project - a code editor developed with React.

I have developed a live code editor with React where there are three files- index.html, index.css, index.js. As soon as I type anything relevant in any of the files which can produce an output, the output is shown in the live screen. I don't have to execute the code seperately.
